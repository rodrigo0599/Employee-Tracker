## Description

For my project, I developed an innovative employee tracking system aimed at simplifying workforce management for businesses. This tool is specifically designed to streamline the process of monitoring employee details, job roles, and departmental assignments. A key aspect of this project was my immersion into the world of mySQL, a robust database management system. I acquired hands-on experience in creating and managing tables directly through a terminal, enhancing my technical skillset in database operations.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine

```sh
1. git clone
```

Enter password for mysql db in server.js

Log into mysql on local machine than enter password

```sh
2. mysql -u root -p
```

Add the schema.sql to create the database structure

```sh
3. SOURCE schema.sql;
```

Add the seeds.sql to populate the database

```sh
4. SOURCE seeds.sql;
```

Install dependencies and start the local server

```sh
5. npm i
```

## Usage

To get started with this project, you'll need to use the integrated terminal in your server.js environment. Here's how to kick things off:

Open your terminal within the server.js environment:

```sh
npm start
```

Once the program starts, you'll see a variety of options. Choose the one that fits your needs.

After selecting an option, simply follow the on-screen prompts to proceed.
Additionally, I've included a helpful video demonstration to guide you through the process.
